# The-Maze-Project
We create a 3D ray-casting game by leveraging an external SDL library. The main goal of this project was to develop a fully working game that would encourage the user to use their imagination and choose a different course of action. Making the game more interesting by adding enemies and weapons (such obstacles) was another goal.

# About SDL2
Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.

# Usage
Execute ./maze or type make run
Use up and down arrow keys to move forward and backward (keys w and s serve the same function)
Use right and left arrow keys to turn the camera arround (keys d and a serve the same function)

# Requirements to Play
Mac OS X or Linux/Ubuntu
